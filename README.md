Confuence Blog: Basic Setup

To start the Actix backend, in the "actix" folder type:

```cmd
./sshTunnel.sh
cargo run
```

To start the React frontend, in the "react-front-end" folder type:

```cmd
npm install
npm run
```

This should open your browser to https://localhost:3000 and show the current UNIX time with the default REACT page.
This time is generated by Actix, when the client makes a GET request for the page, REACT proxies the request to Actix, which returns it in a JSON format to REACT to render.
