Federated Social Media
By Darren Caldwell, Raiyan Chowdhury, Dean Kuyser, Donald Enwan, Euan Lacy

To run open two terminals and navigate to the actix and react-front-end directories respecively.

To start the Actix backend type:

`cargo run`

To start the React frontend type:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This should open your browser to https://localhost:3000 and show the current UNIX time with the default REACT page.
This time is generated by Actix, when the client makes a GET request for the page, REACT proxies the request to Actix, which returns it in a JSON format to REACT to render.
