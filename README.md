To start the Actix backend type:

`cargo run`

To start the React frontend type:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This should open your browser to https://localhost:3000 and show the current UNIX time with the default REACT page.
This time is generated by Actix, when the client makes a GET request for the page, REACT proxies the request to Actix, which returns it in a JSON format to REACT to render.
